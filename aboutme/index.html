				<p>
					Hello, just call me Rafas√© or R.282 for short. If you want to know what it means then read this <a href="http://vampirefreaks.com/journal_comment.php?entry=5777245&amp;a=0" target="_blank"> journal entry.</a><br />
				 	I'm from the Dominican Republic. I graduated from Bronx Community College and currently attend Lehman College<br />
				 	for my BS in computer science. It may be a bit obvious but I live in the Bronx, New York.<br />
				 	<br />
				 	I'm a single father. Anyways you are welcome to befriend me. I'm the type of person people tend to call boring<br />
				 	other get fascinated with. If you ask me I'll say I'm boring. ;)<br /> 
				 	I have seen so many things in life and know so many random facts, that it is actually not very easy to amuse me.<br />
				 	<br />
				 	You may say I'm easily distracted, I just spent the most part of my time enjoying or suffering my thoughts.<br />
				 	I suggest you make sure you have my attention before you start talking to me. However, I have a bad habit of <br />
				 	making people repeat what they just told me. It is to make sure I did not misunderstand or just really<br />
				 	didn't get you the first time. As my English improves this issue has been fading away.<br />
				 	<br />
				 	I like computers, electronic devices ( Technology in general ) I love music, a lot of different styles,<br />
				 	but my favorites are rock, metal, folk, and all that has to be with goth and industrial.<br />
				 	Everyone says I'm weird, even my parents, I like when they say that rather than<br />
				 	"hey you are like this friend I know..." It gets on my nerves! <br />
				 	<br />
				 	Sometimes you may bribe me with food. Don't get me wrong, I just like tasty food.<br />
